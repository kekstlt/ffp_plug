# Description:
#   rcorder (from NetBSD)
#   
#   rcorder is designed to print out a dependency ordering of a set of
#   interdependent files. Typically it is used to find an execution
#   sequence for a set of shell scripts in which certain files must be
#   executed before others (such as rc.d startup and shutdown scripts).
